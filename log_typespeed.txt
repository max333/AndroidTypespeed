+ Settings: 
    -color pickers (background/text). Might need a third color if typed characters are shown.
    -speed
    -text size, font
    
+ High scores, separated by speed level

+ After each game show the errors.

+ Sound effects.  Haptic effect.

+ It looks like the keyboard is just hiding the stuff underneath, not resizing
  everything.

+ Pause (user request, or phone call...).  Should save the full game state.
  What if the orientation changed... are the rules even the same?
  The number of lines are going to be different.
  The speed for each word should be different: (full length - word length) / dt.
  Vary the speed according to word length such that each word remains on screen the same time.

+ Maybe could save the positions as percent of screen size.  Could then refit on 
  deformed screen.  Maybe the words would overlap then, but a small price to pay.
  Could also change the font size on resize.
  
+ Will need to find some list of words.

+ Make an "About" about the history and link to code on github.

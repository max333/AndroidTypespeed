+ Clock for drawing.  
  The input events, or output (new word) do not have to trigger a redraw
  of the TypespeedView, but they can redraw the EditView (clear on Enter or Space).
  Each input event change the echo area and possibly the main scrolling view.
  BlockingQueue to communicate between UI input thread and worker thread.


+ Settings: 
    -color pickers (background/text). Might need a third color if typed characters are shown.
    -speed
    -text size, font
    
+ High scores, separated by speed level

+ After each game show the errors.

+ Sound effects.  Haptic effect.

+ It looks like the keyboard is just hiding the stuff underneath, not resizing
  everything.

+ Pause (user request, or phone call...).  Should save the full game state.
  What if the orientation changed... are the rules even the same?
  The number of lines are going to be different.
  The speed for each word should be different: (full length - word length) / dt.
  Vary the speed according to word length such that each word remains on screen the same time.

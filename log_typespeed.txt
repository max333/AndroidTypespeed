+ Word generator over time to keep up with a time increasing target rate. Log.

+ Related to above, but different: increase the scroll speed.  It is not actually necessary,
  but it would be better on smaller screens to avoid word overlaps when many words are being
  generated.

+ Modify OutOfBounds such that it checks for the right side of the word getting out
  instead of the left.  Will also need to modify the speed of each word depending on its width
  if each word is to spend the same time on screen.

+ When showing game over dialog, maybe disable buttons for 0.25s in case the user is typing furiously and
  might hit a Dialog button.

+ High scores, separated by speed level.

+ After each game show the errors in a Dialog.

+ Settings: 
    -color pickers (background/text). Might need a third color if typed characters are shown.
    -speed
    -text size, font
    
+ Sound effects.  Haptic effect.

+ Pause (user request, or phone call...).  Should save the full game state (GSON?).
  What if the orientation changed... are the rules even the same?
  The number of lines are going to be different.
  The speed for each word should be different: (full length - word length) / dt.
  Vary the speed according to word length such that each word remains on screen the same time.

+ Maybe could save the positions as percent of screen size.  Could then refit on 
  deformed screen.  Maybe the words would overlap then, but a small price to pay.
  Could also change the font size on resize.
  
+ Will need to find some list of words.  Maybe many languages.
  Maybe let users use their own file.

+ Make an "About" about the history and link to code on github.
  Creative commons attribution if needed.

+ Game variant: mirror (reversed words and text flowing the "wrong" way).
  The configuration could also be used for internationalization.

+ Game variant: Add numbers or symbols to words.
  
+ Target api 2.3 since I read somewhere in Android Pro 4 about proguard or such being
  setup only for that version and higher.

+ Change the x, y measures such that they are screen percent.
  Will also need some way to figure out the dimension of a word on the current
  screen configuration and adjust the speed, the out-of-bounds and the placement
  of new words accordingly.

+ When showing game over dialog, maybe disable buttons for 0.25s.

+ Settings: 
    -color pickers (background/text). Might need a third color if typed characters are shown.
    -speed
    -text size, font
    
+ High scores, separated by speed level

+ After each game show the errors in a Dialog.

+ Sound effects.  Haptic effect.

+ Pause (user request, or phone call...).  Should save the full game state.
  What if the orientation changed... are the rules even the same?
  The number of lines are going to be different.
  The speed for each word should be different: (full length - word length) / dt.
  Vary the speed according to word length such that each word remains on screen the same time.

+ Maybe could save the positions as percent of screen size.  Could then refit on 
  deformed screen.  Maybe the words would overlap then, but a small price to pay.
  Could also change the font size on resize.
  
+ Will need to find some list of words.  Maybe many languages.
  Maybe let users use their own file.

+ Make an "About" about the history and link to code on github.
  Creative commons attribution if needed.

+ Game variant: mirror.
  The configuration could also be used for internationalization.
